  abstract = {Objective To examine the performance of screening for early, preterm and term pre-eclampsia (PE) at 11--13 weeks' gestation by maternal factors and combinations of mean arterial pressure (MAP), uterine artery (UtA) pulsatility index (PI), serum placental growth factor (PlGF) and serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A). Methods The data for this study were derived from three previously reported prospective non-intervention screening studies at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks' gestation in a combined total of 61 174 singleton pregnancies, including 1770 (2.9\%) that developed PE. Bayes' theorem was used to combine the prior distribution of gestational age at delivery with PE, obtained from maternal characteristics, with various combinations of biomarker multiples of the median (MoM) values to derive patient-specific risks of delivery with PE at {$<$} 37 weeks' gestation. The performance of such screening was estimated. Results In pregnancies that developed PE, compared to those without PE, the MoM values of UtA-PI and MAP were increased and those of PAPP-A and PlGF were decreased, and the deviation from normal was greater for early than late PE for all four biomarkers. Combined screening by maternal factors, UtA-PI, MAP and PlGF predicted 90\% of early PE, 75\% of preterm PE and 41\% of term PE, at a screen-positive rate of 10\%; inclusion of PAPP-A did not improve the performance of screening. The performance of screening depended on the racial origin of the women; on screening by a combination of maternal factors, MAP, UtA-PI and PlGF and using a risk cut-off of 1 in 100 for PE at {$<$} 37 weeks in Caucasian women, the screen-positive rate was 10\% and detection rates for early, preterm and term PE were 88\%, 69\% and 40\%, respectively. With the same method of screening and risk cut-off in women of Afro-Caribbean racial origin, the screen-positive rate was 34\% and detection rates for early, preterm and term PE were 100\%, 92\% and 75\%, respectively. Conclusion Screening by maternal factors and biomarkers at 11--13 weeks' gestation can identify a high proportion of pregnancies that develop early and preterm PE. {\copyright} 2018 Crown copyright.

  abstract = {The established method of the assessment of the risk for development of preeclampsia is to identify risk factors from maternal demographic characteristics and medical history; in the presence of such factors, the patient is classified as high risk and in their absence as low risk. Although this approach is simple to perform, it has poor performance of the prediction of preeclampsia and does not provide patient-specific risks. This review describes a new approach that allows the estimation of patient-specific risks of delivery with preeclampsia before any specified gestational age by maternal demographic characteristics and medical history with biomarkers obtained either individually or in combination at any stage in pregnancy. In the competing risks approach, every woman has a personalized distribution of gestational age at delivery with preeclampsia; whether she experiences preeclampsia or not before a specified gestational age depends on competition between delivery before or after the development of preeclampsia. The personalized distribution comes from the application of Bayes theorem to combine a previous distribution, which is determined from maternal factors, with likelihoods from biomarkers. As new data become available, what were posterior probabilities take the role as the previous probability, and data collected at different stages are combined by repeating the application of Bayes theorem to form a new posterior at each stage, which allows for dynamic prediction of preeclampsia. The competing risk model can be used for precision medicine and risk stratification at different stages of pregnancy. In the first trimester, the model has been applied to identify a high-risk group that would benefit from preventative therapeutic interventions. In the second trimester, the model has been used to stratify the population into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups in need of different intensities of subsequent monitoring, thereby minimizing unexpected adverse perinatal events. The competing risks model can also be used in surveillance of women presenting to specialist clinics with signs or symptoms of hypertensive disorders; combination of maternal factors and biomarkers provide patient-specific risks for preeclampsia that lead to personalized stratification of the intensity of monitoring, with risks updated on each visit on the basis of biomarker measurements.},
